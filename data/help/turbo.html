    <h1>Turbo Chart</h1>
    
    <p>The Turbo Quick Chart displays intake manifold pressure, atmosphere pressure, 
        and engine speed throughout the snapshot. 
        This chart is essential for evaluating turbocharger performance, particularly for detecting 
        turbo drag during engine cranking.</p>

    <h2>Capturing Turbo Data</h2>
    
    <div class="info">
        <strong>Important:</strong> To properly evaluate turbo performance during cranking, 
        start your snapshot capture 
        with the key on and engine off. This ensures you capture the manifold pressure behavior 
        during the entire cranking event.
    </div>
    
    <p>Proper snapshot capture procedure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn the key to the ON position (do not start the engine)</li>
        <li>Start the snapshot capture in Bobcat Engine Analyzer</li>
        <li>Crank and start the engine</li>
        <li>Allow the engine to run and capture data as needed</li>
        <li>Stop the snapshot capture</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Reading the Chart</h2>
    <p>The chart displays intake manifold pressure on the Y-axis and time on the X-axis. 
        Look for these key indicators:</p>
    
    <h3>Atmospheric Pressure Baseline</h3>
    <p>Before cranking, with the key on and engine off, 
        manifold pressure should be at atmospheric pressure (approximately 11.3 to 12.3 PSI at Colorado Front Range elevations).</p>
    
    <h3>Cranking Period</h3>
    <p>During cranking, the engine acts as an air pump. A healthy turbo allows air to flow freely, resulting in a slight vacuum (negative gauge pressure) in the intake manifold.</p>
    
    <h2>Detecting Turbo Drag</h2>
    <p>Turbo drag occurs when the turbocharger bearings or compressor wheel have excessive resistance, restricting airflow during cranking.</p>
    
    <h3>This is the same chart as above, but zoomed in on the cranking period</h3>
    <img src="../images/turbo_drag.png" alt="Turbo drag comparison" style="max-width: 1000px;">
    
    <p>The example above shows an engine cranking at 317 RPM with intake manifold pressure pulling <strong>0.3 PSI below atmospheric pressure</strong>. This indicates a healthy turbo with minimal drag.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Good Turbo</strong> - Manifold pressure drops less than 0.9 PSI below atmospheric during cranking</li>
        <li><strong>Typical Range</strong> - 0.2 to 0.5 PSI vacuum during normal cranking</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Turbo Drag Condition</h3>
    <p>If the intake manifold pressure pulls <strong>0.9 PSI or more below atmospheric pressure</strong> during cranking, this indicates a dragging turbo.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dragging Turbo</strong> - Manifold pressure drops 0.9 PSI or more below atmospheric</li>
        <li><strong>Severe Drag</strong> - Manifold pressure drops 1.5 PSI or more below atmospheric</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="info">
        <strong>Diagnostic Note:</strong> A dragging turbo restricts airflow into the engine, making it harder to start 
        and reducing performance. This condition typically indicates worn turbo bearings or compressor wheel damage that 
        requires turbocharger service or replacement.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Running Engine Analysis</h2>
    <p>The Turbo chart also shows manifold pressure during engine operation:</p>
    
    <h3>Idle</h3>
    <p>At idle and light loads, manifold pressure will rise only slightly above atmospheric pressure.</p>
    
    <h3>Boost Conditions</h3>
    <p>Under load, the turbocharger compresses intake air, creating the highest manifold pressure (boost). 
        Higher loads result in higher boost pressure.<br>
        <strong>At Colorado elevations</strong>, 2.4L boost pressure will be around 25 PSI at full load.
        A 3.4L will be around 30 PSI at full load.<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2>Related Engine Use Data</h2>
    <p>For comprehensive turbo and engine performance analysis, also review:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="eud_speed_load.html">Engine Use Data: Speed/Load</a> - Analyze operating conditions including cold starts and light load operation</li>
        <li><a href="eud_speed_band.html">Engine Use Data: Speed Band</a> - Review engine speed distribution</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="info">
        <strong>Note:</strong> When diagnosing turbo drag, pay particular attention to engine operation when running cold, slow, and unloaded, as these conditions can reveal performance issues not apparent under normal operating conditions.

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the <strong>Vertical Cursor</strong> to align cranking speed with manifold pressure readings</li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Values</strong> tool to measure exact pressure drop during cranking</li>
        <li>Zoom into the cranking period for detailed pressure analysis</li>
        <li>Compare multiple snapshots to track turbo condition over time</li>
    </ul>
