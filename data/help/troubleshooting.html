    <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
    
    <p>Solutions to common issues you may encounter while using Snapshot Decoder.</p>
    
    <h2>File Loading Issues</h2>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> "Unknown snapshot type" error when opening a file
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> The file may not be a valid snapshot export or may be corrupted. 
        Ensure you're opening a snapshot file exported from a Bobcat diagnostic tool. 
        Try re-exporting the snapshot if possible.<br>
        Be sure to capture all the engien PIDs when creating a Snapshot. 
        Do not choose any of the diagnostic sub-categories of PIDs in Bobcat Engine Analyzer.
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> File opens but no data appears
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Check that the snapshot file contains actual data rows. 
        Use Data → Raw Data to view what was imported. 
        Empty snapshots may occur if the capture was interrupted.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Snapshot Quality Issues</h2>
    
    <p>Sometimes snapshots may contain unexpected data or produce unusual chart results. Use the Data menu to inspect the snapshot quality and diagnose issues.</p>
    
    <h3>Using Raw Data Table to Diagnose Issues</h3>
    
    <p>The <strong>Raw Data Table</strong> (<code>Data → Raw Data</code>) shows the original data exactly as it was imported from the snapshot file, before any processing or cleaning.</p>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Charts show unexpected values or missing data
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Open the Raw Data Table to check the original snapshot data:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Missing columns</strong> - If expected PIDs are missing, the snapshot may not have been captured with all engine PIDs selected in Bobcat Engine Analyzer</li>
            <li><strong>Empty cells or zeros</strong> - Indicates the sensor was not active or not reporting during capture</li>
            <li><strong>Text instead of numbers</strong> - Some cells may contain error codes or status text instead of numeric values</li>
            <li><strong>Inconsistent data</strong> - Look for sudden jumps, repeated values, or obvious errors that indicate capture problems</li>
            <li><strong>Short snapshots</strong> - Check the number of rows to ensure the snapshot captured enough data for meaningful analysis</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Using Clean Data Table to Verify Processing</h3>
    
    <p>The <strong>Clean Data Table</strong> (<code>Data → Clean Table</code>) shows the processed data after Snapshot Decoder has cleaned and converted the raw data. This is the data used for all charts.</p>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Charts don't match expectations or show gaps
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Compare the Clean Data Table with the Raw Data Table:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Missing rows</strong> - Some rows may have been removed if they contained invalid data</li>
            <li><strong>Converted values</strong> - Check that unit conversions were applied correctly (e.g., temperature, pressure)</li>
            <li><strong>Calculated columns</strong> - Some PIDs may be calculated from other values; verify the source data is present</li>
            <li><strong>Time or Frame column</strong> - Ensure the time/frame column is present and sequential</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Common Snapshot Quality Problems</h3>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Snapshot was captured with diagnostic sub-categories instead of all engine PIDs
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> When creating snapshots in Bobcat Engine Analyzer, always select <strong>All Engine PIDs</strong>, not diagnostic sub-categories. 
        Sub-category snapshots may be missing critical PIDs needed for Quick Charts and analysis. 
        Check the Raw Data Table to see which PIDs are present, then re-capture the snapshot if necessary.
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Snapshot capture was interrupted or too short
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Open the Clean Data Table and check the number of data rows. 
        Short snapshots (fewer than 50-100 rows) may not capture enough information for meaningful analysis. 
        For events like cranking or acceleration, ensure the snapshot capture spans the entire event plus some time before and after.
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Data shows flat lines or no variation
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Use the Clean Data Table to verify the PID values:
        <ul>
            <li>If all values are identical, the sensor may not have been active during capture</li>
            <li>If values are all zero, check the Raw Data Table to see if this is the original data or a conversion issue</li>
            <li>Some parameters only change under specific conditions (e.g., EGR only operates when engine is warm)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info">
        <strong>Best Practice:</strong> Before analyzing a snapshot, quickly review both the Raw Data Table and Clean Data Table to verify data quality. 
        This helps identify capture issues early and saves time troubleshooting unexpected chart results.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Chart Issues</h2>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> A Quick Chart button does nothing when clicked
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Quick charts are only enabled when the required PIDs are present 
        in the snapshot.<br>
        For example, if the engine is not equipted with an intake throttle valve, 
        clicking the air throttle Quick Chart button will do nothing.
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Chart appears blank or shows a flat line
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> This typically means the parameter had no variation during capture. 
        Try zooming in to see small changes, or check if the sensor was active during the snapshot.
        Use <code>Data → Clean Table</code> to verify the actual PID values.
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Chart zoom is not working properly
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Click the Home button in the toolbar to reset the view. 
        If zoom behavior seems erratic, try clicking the zoom tool again to re-select it.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Display Issues</h2>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Text or buttons appear cut off
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Try maximizing the window or increasing screen resolution. 
        The application works best at 1280x720 or higher resolution.<br>
        Right-click your Desktop and choose Display Settings. 
        Under Scale & Layout make sure Scale is 100%.
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Charts look blurry or pixelated
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> On high-DPI displays, ensure Windows display scaling is set 
        to 100%. Unusual scaling values may affect rendering.
    </div>
