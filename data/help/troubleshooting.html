    <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
    
    <p>Solutions to common issues you may encounter while using Snapshot Decoder.</p>
    
    <h2>File Loading Issues</h2>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> "Unknown snapshot type" error when opening a file
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> The file may not be a valid snapshot export or may be corrupted. 
        Ensure you're opening a snapshot file exported from a Bobcat diagnostic tool. 
        Try re-exporting the snapshot if possible.<br>
        Be sure to capture all the engien PIDs when creating a Snapshot. 
        Do not choose any of the diagnostic sub-categories of PIDs in Bobcat Engine Analyzer.
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> File opens but no data appears
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Check that the snapshot file contains actual data rows. 
        Use Data → Raw Data to view what was imported. 
        Empty snapshots may occur if the capture was interrupted.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Chart Issues</h2>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> A Quick Chart button does nothing when clicked
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Quick charts are only enabled when the required PIDs are present 
        in the snapshot.<br>
        For example, if the engine is not equipted with an intake throttle valve, 
        clicking the air throttle Quick Chart button will do nothing.
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Chart appears blank or shows a flat line
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> This typically means the parameter had no variation during capture. 
        Try zooming in to see small changes, or check if the sensor was active during the snapshot.
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Chart zoom is not working properly
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Click the Home button in the toolbar to reset the view. 
        If zoom behavior seems erratic, try clicking the zoom tool again to re-select it.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Display Issues</h2>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Text or buttons appear cut off
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Try maximizing the window or increasing screen resolution. 
        The application works best at 1280x720 or higher resolution.<br>
        Right-click your Desktop and choose Display Settings. 
        Under Scale & Layout make sure Scale is 100%.
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Charts look blurry or pixelated
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> On high-DPI displays, ensure Windows display scaling is set 
        to 100%. Unusual scaling values may affect rendering.
    </div>
