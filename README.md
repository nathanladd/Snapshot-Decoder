# Snapshot-Decoder
Windows desktop app to interpret engine data saved in a Bobcat Engine Analyzer Snapshot.
This app can open fake .xls and .xlsx files, parse the Snapshot data in order to determine 
what type of Snaapshot file has been opened and pull any general machine information
from the Snapshot header. Snapshot Decoder can then read in all frames af all PIDs stored 
in the Snapshot delineated file and store them in a Data Frame.

The PIDs can be searched, selected, and charted. There are also 'Quick Charts' with PIDs
pre-selected for common diagnostic tasks avaiolable at a click of a button.

Charts can be saved as graphic files and a complete report .pdf file can be generated.
